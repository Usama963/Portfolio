### My experience :office:
I have extensive experience in QA, actively participating in all testing activities throughout the UAT and production SDLC. My expertise includes functional and database testing, defect reporting, tracking, and reproducing issues. I design, write, and execute both manual and automated test cases, leveraging Cypress.io for automation. I ensure testability in early project phases, manage QA processes, and coordinate stand-up meetings. My role involves validating that applications meet business requirements, system goals, and user needs while effectively communicating test progress and results to stakeholders. Additionally, I have experience in release management, client handling, and have conducted presentations on Cypress Automation for QA teams and project managers.
